// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guest_list = ["Ali","Adnan","Kamran"]

for(let i=0; i<guest_list.length;i++){
    console.log(`Hi ${guest_list[i]}, I'm inviting you to dine with me`)
}
