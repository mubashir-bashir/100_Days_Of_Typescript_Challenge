// Compound Assignment Operators : Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.
function compoundOperators() {
    var x = 4;
    console.log("initial value of x is ", 4);
    x += 10;
    console.log("After additon", x);
    x -= 10;
    console.log("After Subtraction", x);
    x *= 4;
    console.log("After Multiplication", x);
    x /= 8;
    console.log("After Division", x);
}
