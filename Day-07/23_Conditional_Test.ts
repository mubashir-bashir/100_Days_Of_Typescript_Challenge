// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.


let car = "Rolls Roys"

console.log('Is car is !== "Rolls Roys"? I predict False')
console.log(car !== 'Rolls Roys')

console.log('Is Car name start with "R"? I predict True')
console.log(car.startsWith('R'))

console.log('Is Car name ends with "R"? I predict False')
console.log(car.endsWith("R"))

console.log('Is Car name contain with "lls"? I predict True')
console.log(car.includes("lls"))
